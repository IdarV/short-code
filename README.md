# short-code
This is a project where i try to list anagrams from a word list with the least
amount of _characters_ in different languages. This is called _code golfing_. Feel free to improve a language or add a new one, and send a pull request :)

In Linux, OSX and Windows(GitBash) you can count the file size with ```wc -c [filename]```

Results:

01. Ruby: 61
02. Perl: 87
03. Scala: 100
04. Kotlin: 104
05. Haskell 118
06. Python: 122
07. PHP: 133
08. Javascript: 135
09. R: 152
10. Elixir: 239
11. Go: 276
12. Java: 333

Rules:
- New languages should follow the same folder and naming conventions
- All languages should have a readable example (how it would look as a readable, normal program)
- New languages should have a information file containing language version and how to run the script
- Passing the filename as an argument is allowed
- The output have to comma seperate the words (see _Example of expected output_ below)

Example of expected output:

```
canters, scanter, nectars
case
decimal, claimed, medical
alerted, treadle, related
calendar
chill
dealing, aligned
allergy, gallery
gravy
general, enlarge, gleaner
created, reacted
mitered, merited
topical, capitol
