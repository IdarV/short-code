# short-code
This is a project where i try to list anagrams from a word list with the least
amount of _characters_ in different languages.

In Ubuntu, OSX and Windows(GitBash) you can count size with ```wc -c [filename]```

Rules:
- New languages should follow the same folder and naming structures
- New languages should have a readable example, a short example and a copy of the word list
- Passing the filename as an argument is allowed

Current results:

1. Perl: 87
2. Ruby: 97
3. Kotlin: 104
4. Python: 122
5. Scala: 135
6. Javascript: 138
7. Elixir: 239
8. Java: 333

Expected output:

```
canters, scanter, nectars

alerted, treadle, related
calendar

dealing, aligned
allergy, gallery
gravy
general, enlarge, gleaner
